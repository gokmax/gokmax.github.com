        <!--Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. Innovation -->
    <!--has no limit. The only limit is your imagination. It is time for you to -->
    <!--begin thinking out of box. If you are involved in a growing industry, think-->
    <!--of ways to become more efficient; more customer-friendly; and easier to do -->
    <!--business with. If you are involved in a shrinking industry -- get out of it -->
    <!--quickly and change before you become obsolete; out of work; or out of -->
    <!--business. And remember that procrastination is not an option here. Start -->
    <!--innovating now!-->

        <!--Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment -->
    <!--where excellence is expected. There is no shortcut to excellence. You will -->
    <!--have to make the commitment to make excellence your priority. Use your talents, -->
    <!--abilities, and skills in the best way possible and get ahead of others by -->
    <!--giving that little extra. Live by a higher standard and pay attention to the -->
    <!--details that really do make difference. Excellence is not difficult -- simply-->
    <!--decide right now to give it your best shot -- and you will be amazed with what-->
    <!--life gives you back.-->

        <!--The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't -->
    <!--found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, -->
    <!--you'll know when you find it. I've got it down to four words:"Do what you love." -->
    <!--Seek out an occupation that gives you a sense of meaning, direction and -->
    <!--satisfaction in life. Having a sense of purpose and striving towards goals -->
    <!--give life meaning, direction and satisfaction. It not only contributes to -->
    <!--health and longevity, but also makes you feel better in difficult times. Do -->
    <!--you jump out of bed on Monday mornings and look forward to the work week? If -->
    <!--the answer is "no", keep looking, you'll know when you find it.-->
